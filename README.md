# Interactive JavaScript Map

Interactive Map created using Leaflet JavaScript library and OpenStreetMap Tile Layers.

Real earthquake data was imported from USGS in GeoJSON format and added to the map.

The map is interactive and has a few different base layers that can be toggled such as Street Maps and Satellite maps.

The data layers such as tectonic plates and earthquakes can also be toggled on and off.

Earthquake indicators can be clicked to show a pop up box containing details of the Earthquake such as time and place, and magnitude and depth.

The size of the earthquake indicators is based on the Magnitude of the earthquake.

The colour of the indicators is based on the depth of the earthquake.
