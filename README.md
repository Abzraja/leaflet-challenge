# Interactive JavaScript Map

Interactive Map created using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) JavaScript library and [OpenStreetMap Tile Layers](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_servers).

Real earthquake data was imported from [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/) in [GeoJSON](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) format and added to the map.

* The map is interactive and has a few different base layers that can be toggled such as Street Maps and Satellite maps.

* The data layers such as tectonic plates and earthquakes can also be toggled on and off.

* Earthquake indicators can be clicked to show a pop up box containing details of the Earthquake such as time and place, and magnitude and depth.

* The size of the earthquake indicators is based on the Magnitude of the earthquake.

* The colour of the indicators is based on the depth of the earthquake.
